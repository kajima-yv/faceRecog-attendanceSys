# faceRecog-attendanceSys

This is a college assignment project of Face Recognition based Attendance System

## Getting Started

The folder **Dataset** is contained with files of faces recognized by the app.  
The CSV file is where the Attendance Markings are stored.  
**AttendanceSys** is the compiled code where all the systems of recording and storing is.  
**Basics** is the basics code of the system tested.  

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Python 3.+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [dlib](https://pypi.org/project/dlib/)
- [Face Recognition lib](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/)

## Running the tests

When all the prerequisites have been installed you can store the Face you want to compare at [Dataset](https://github.com/kajima-yv/faceRecog-attendanceSys/tree/main/Dataset).  
And then you can run the file **AttendanceSys**, where the system would call a webcam window  
and record all the faces in frame to compare with the saved/stored face in the folder **Dataset**.
